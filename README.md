sparseGraph
===========

It has been shown that L1-norm regularization does not recover sparse
solutions in a Laplacian-constrained Gaussian Markov Random Field
setting. **sparseGraph** provides a method to estimate sparse graphs via
nonconvex regularization functions.

------------

You can install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
> devtools::install_github("mirca/sparseGraph")
```

#### Microsoft Windows
